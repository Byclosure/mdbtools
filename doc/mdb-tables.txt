NAME
  mdb-tables - Get listing of tables in an MDB database
SYNOPSIS
  mdb-tables [-S] [-1 | -d<delimiter>] <database>

DESCRIPTION
  mdb-tables is a utility program distributed with MDB Tools. 

  It produces a list of tables contained within an MDB database in a format suitable for use in shell scripts.

OPTIONS
  -S            Show system tables. System tables are generally those beginning with 'MSys'

  -1            specifies that the tables should be listed 1 per line.

  -d delimiter  specifies an alternative delimiter. If no delimiter is specified, table names will be delimited by a tab character, or by newline if the -1 option was specified.

NOTES 

HISTORY
  mdb-tables first appeared in MDB Tools 0\.3

AUTHORS
  The mdb-tables utility was written by Brian Bruns

BUGS
  Access allows for tables to have spaces embeded in the table name.  You must specify a delimiter (-d) if you intend on piping the output of mdb-tables to a program such as awk or cut.
