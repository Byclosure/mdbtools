OPTIONS
  -H            Supress header row

  -d 		Specify an alternative column delimiter If no delimiter is specified, table names will be delimited by a , (comma) character.
  -R            Specify a row delimiter
  -I            INSERT statements (instead of CSV)
  -D            Set the date format (see strftime(3) for details)
  -S            Sanitize names (replace spaces etc. with underscore)
  -q            Use to wrap text-like fields. Default is ".
  -X            Use to escape quoted characters within a field.  Default is doubling.
