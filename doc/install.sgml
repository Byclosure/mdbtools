		<title>What is <productname>MDB Tools</productname>?</title>

		<para>
<productname>MDB Tools</productname> is a suite of libraries and programs to facilitate the use of Microsoft Access databases, also known as Jet databases after the Microsoft's Jet Database Engine or as MDB databases after the .mdb extension used by the file containing the database. 
		</para>
		<para>
<productname>MDB Tools</productname>is open source software (also known as free software if you prefer) which means source code is provided under a license which allows you as a user to modify and redistribute the software.  In particular, the libraries that come with <productname>MDB Tools</productname> are licensed under the Gnu LGPL (Lesser General Public License) and the utility programs, graphical interface, and miscellania are licensed under the Gnu GPL (General Public License).  More information about these licenses can be found in the <filename>COPYING.LIB</filename> and <filename>COPYING</filename> files distributed with <productname>MDB Tools</productname> or from the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org">Gnu site</ulink>.

			<title>Components of the <productname>MDB Tools</productname> Suite</title>
			<para>
<productname>MDB Tools</productname> is composed of three libraries, a set of command line utilities and a graphical interface.
			</para>
		<sect1 id="libmdb">
		<title>LibMDB</title>
		<para>
libmdb is the lowest level library. It handles the details of reading from and writing to the MDB file format. Atop this library sits all the other functionality of <productname>MDB Tools</productname>.
		</para>
		<para>
A complete description of libmdb will be available in the forthcoming <productname>MDB Tools</productname> Programmer's Guide. For now you can look at the utility programs for a general idea of how to use the API, it's fairly straightforward.
		</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="utilities">
		<title>Command Line Utilities</title>
		<para>
<productname>MDB Tools</productname> comes with a set of command line utilties that allow mdb files to be used in shell scripting, extraction to another database, and similar functions. Each program is documented in its man page. A brief synopsis follows.

		<sect1 id="libmdbsql">
		<title>LibMDBSQL (the SQL Engine)</title>
		<para>
LibMDBSQL is an SQL engine which provides a subset of the SQL query language to access MDB databases.  It is used with the ODBC driver, by the mdb-sql utility, and by the query window in gmdb2.
		</para>
		<para>
For a description of the supported SQL, see the mdb-sql man page.
		</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="libmdbodbc">
		<title>LibMDBODBC</title>
		<para>
LibMDBODBC is an ODBC driver that works with the unixODBC driver manager to allow MDB Tools to work with such programs as PHP and Perl (via DBD::ODBC).  At the time of this writing, the breadth of coverage for the driver is rather limited. If you have specific problems with it, please contact the list and they can most likely be resolved.  
		</para>
		<para>
The ODBC driver relies on LibMDB and LibMDBSQL. 
		</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="gmdb2">
		<title>Gmdb2</title>
		<para>
Gmdb2 is a graphical interface to the functionality of MDB Tools.  Its interface resembles that of access with a tabbed interface to each of the object types in the database (tables, queries, forms, etc...).  Additonally, it sports an SQL Query window, and a file debugger useful for developers or anybody interested in examining the dark secrets of the MDB file format.
		</para>
		<para>
For information on how to use gmdb2, see the manual under the Help menu.
		</para>
		</sect1>

	<chapter id="requirements">
		<title>Requirements</title>
		<para>
<productname>MDB Tools</productname> like most packages has some requirements for libraries and such on your system.  Most of them are optional and will turn off certain features if not present.
		</para>
		<sect1 id="reqtable">
		<title>Requirements Matrix</title>
		<para>
The following matrix lists all requirements and which features they affect.  An X in the major feature categories (SQL, ODBC, gmdb2) means these features will be turned off if the prequisite is not found.

		<para>
RPMs are made available for major releases (not including pre-release or release candidates). The RPM packages are split up along feature boundaries with a core package, a development package, an ODBC package, and a graphical package. To install, simply log in as root and run the following.
<screen>

		<title>Configuring from the tarball</title>
		<para>
If you are installing a release or snapshot tarball follow these steps. These steps assume the tarballs name is <filename>mdbtools-0.5.tgz</filename>.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>zcat mdbtools-0.5.tgz | tar xvf -</userinput> 
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd mdbtools-0.5</userinput> 
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure</userinput> 
</screen>
If you want to include ODBC support, use the --with-unixodbc argument with the location you installed it to (<filename>/usr/local</filename> by default).
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>zcat mdbtools-0.5.tgz | tar xvf -</userinput> 
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd mdbtools-0.5</userinput>

		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="cvscfg">
		<title>Configuring from CVS</title>
		<para>
If you are looking for the very latest code you can check out it out of CVS and compile.  The configure step uses the <filename>autogen.sh</filename> script so it's a bit different.
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mdbtools login</userinput>

<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd mdbtools</userinput> 
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./autogen.sh --with-unixodbc=/usr/local</userinput>

	</para>
		<sect1 id="mdbpath">
		<title>MDBPATH</title>
		<para>
If you store your MDB files together in directories you can use the MDBPATH environment variable to have <productname>MDB Tools</productname> search the path similiar to PATH, MANPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or LIBPATH), etc... Like those, the : (colon) is used as a separator.
		</para>
		<para>
If you run sh, ksh, or bash
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>MDBPATH=/home/myuser/mdbfiles:/data/mdbfiles ; export MDBPATH</userinput> 
</screen>
If you run csh or tcsh
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>setenv MDBPATH /home/myuser/mdbfiles:/data/mdbfiles</userinput> 
</screen>
This will cause <productname>MDB Tools</productname> to first attempt to open the file using the filename or path provided (current directory or absolute path), then to walk through each entry in the MDBPATH file looking for it. It will stop at the first match.
		</para>
		<para>
The MDBPATH variable affects all utilities and any program calling mdb_open().
		</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="iconv">
		<title>Character set encoding</title>
		<para>
Jet 4 databases are encoded using UCS2-LE (Unicode 2 byte little endian) encoding.  MDB Tools will convert these values using the "iconv" standard to UTF-8 by default.  If your terminal or other output uses an encoding other than UTF-8 you can override the default behaviour by setting the MDBICONV to the desired character set.
		</para>
		<para>
For sh, ksh, or bash
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>MDBICONV=ISO_8859-1 ; export MDBICONV</userinput> 
</screen>
Or for csh or tcsh
<screen>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>setenv MDBICONV ISO_8859-1</userinput>
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>
To view a list of possible character sets, you can run the <command>iconv --list</command> command on most Linux systems.  Otherwise, consult your vendors documentation.
		</para>
		<para>
Jet 3 databases use the character set of the machine on which they were created.  For US-English systems this will be cp1252 which is assumed by MDB Tools as the default.  To use a file generated with another version of Access, set the MDB_JET3_CHARSET environment variable.  
		</para>
		</sect1>
		<sect1 id="odbcini">
		<title>ODBC</title>
		<para>
In order to use ODBC you must place an entry in the <filename>odbcinst.ini</filename> file.

    <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</para>

    <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

    <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

    <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

    <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</para>

    <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.

    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-3">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-4">
    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</para>

      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given

    </orderedlist>
    
    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
    
    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-9">
    <title>TERMINATION</title>
    
    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-10">
    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>

  <sect1 id="gfdl-11">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote id="sample-copyright"><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
