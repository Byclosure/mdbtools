Things to Do
------------

file format:

. how does global allocation map work?
. export VBA script
. re-examine KKD records for form design (OLE streams?)
. write support

libmdb:

. Complete the list of datatypes
. Straighten out which functions in libmdb are meant to be used and which   
  ones should be static.
. Create an API reference for libmdb (maybe some man pages).
. Sargs need to support all datatypes
. Need a way to express logical relationships between sargs (tree)
. Add support for index scanning when using sargs
. Use allocation maps to read tables, should be more efficient (done 
  if -DFAST_READ specified)
. write support

utils:

. need program to unpack VBA script to file (see prole)
. Access forms to glade converter ?

SQL Engine:

. SQL Engine does not handle uppercase keywords
. Joins
. OR clauses using sarg trees from above
. insert/updates
. bogus column name in where clause not caught
. const = const type operations not working (e.g. WHERE 0=1)

ODBC:

. Figure out why we get unresolved symbols when ODBC driver load by DM (iODBC 
  only?)
. Boolean not working
. many unimplemented funtions

GMDB:

. Finish debug dissectors
. Export schema not implemented
. Printing not implemented
. Export needs finishing
