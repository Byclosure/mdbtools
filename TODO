Things to Do
------------

. Complete the list of datatypes
. Straighten out which functions in libmdb are meant to be used and which   
  ones should be static.
. Create an API reference for libmdb (maybe some man pages).
. Sargs need to support all datatypes
. Need a way to express logical relationships between sargs (tree)
. Add support for index scanning when using sargs
. Use allocation maps to read tables, should be more efficient
. Figure out why we get unresolved symbols when ODBC driver load by DM
