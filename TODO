Things to Do
------------

. Complete the list of datatypes
. Figure out how to properly determine fixed or variable length columns
. Figure out what happens for varchar columns starting at > 256
. Modify mdb-schema utility support different backend databases
. Modify mdb-export to handle different delimiters/options
. Get automake working
. Check out text file unixODBC driver to see if it can be adapted to use
  libmdb (it already has a SQL parser).
. Straighten out which functions in libmdb are meant to be used and which   ones should be static.
. Create an API reference for libmdb (maybe some man pages).
. Sargs need to support all datatypes
. Need a way to express logical relationships between sargs (tree)
. Add support for index scanning when using sargs
. Convert code to use MSysObjects table for reading catalog.
