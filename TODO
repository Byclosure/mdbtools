Things to Do
------------

file format:

. how does global allocation map work?
. export VB script

. write support

libmdb:

. Complete the list of datatypes
. Straighten out which functions in libmdb are meant to be used and which   
  ones should be static.
. Create an API reference for libmdb (maybe some man pages).
. Sargs need to support all datatypes
. Need a way to express logical relationships between sargs (tree)
. Add support for index scanning when using sargs
. Use allocation maps to read tables, should be more efficient
. write support

utils:

. need program to unpack VBA script to file
. Access forms to glade converter ?

SQL Engine:

. SQL Engine does not handle uppercase keywords
. Joins
. OR clauses using sarg trees from above
. insert/updates

  only?)
