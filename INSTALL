Basic Installation
==================

   $ ./configure 
   $ make 

This will build some useful utilities:

mdb-ver    -- prints the version (JET 3 or 4) of an mdb file
mdb-dump   -- simple hex dump utility that I've been using to look at mdb files
mdb-schema -- prints DDL for the specified table
mdb-export -- export table to CSV format
mdb-tables -- a simple dump of table names to be used with shell scripts
mdb-header -- generates a C header to be used in exporting mdb data to a C prog.
mdb-parsecvs -- generates a C program given a CSV file made with mdb-export
mdb-sql    -- if --enable-sql is specified, a simple SQL engine (also used by 
              ODBC and gmdb).

And some utilities useful for debugging:

prcat      -- prints the catalog table from an mdb file,
prkkd      -- dump of information about design view data given the offset to it.
prtable    -- dump of a table definition.
prdata     -- dump of the data given a table name.

Once MDB Tools has been compiled, libmdb.[so|a] will be in the src/libmdb 
directory and the utility programs will be in the src/util directory.
You can then run 'make install' as root to install (to /usr/local by default).
