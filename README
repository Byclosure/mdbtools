This is mdbtools version 0.4

This software is still beta so don't expect too much.

If you are interested in helping, read the HACKING file for a description of 
where the code stands and what has been gleened of the file format.

The initial goal of these tools is to be able to extract data structures and 
data from mdb files.  This goal will of course expand over time as the file 
format becomes more well understood.  

Files in libmdb are licensed under LGPL and the utilities under the GPL, see 
COPYING.LIB and COPYING files respectively.

To install see the INSTALL file
