This is mdbtools version 0.4

Welcome to the exciting world of MDB Tools! In short, MDB Tools is a set of 
program to help you use Microsoft Access file in various settings.  The major
pieces are:

. libmdb    - the core library that allows access to MDB files programatically.
. libmdbsql - builds on libmdb to provide a SQL engine (ala Jet)
. utils     - provides command line utilities to list tables, export schema, 
              and data, show the version of the files, and other useful stuff.
. mdb-sql   - a command line SQL tool that allows one to type sql queries and
              get results.
. odbc      - An ODBC driver for use with unixODBC driver manager.  Allows 
              one to use MDB files with PHP for example.
. gmdb      - The GTK MDB File Viewer and debugger.  Still alpha, but making
              great progress.

If you are interested in helping, read the HACKING file for a description of 
where the code stands and what has been gleened of the file format.

The initial goal of these tools is to be able to extract data structures and 
data from mdb files.  This goal will of course expand over time as the file 
format becomes more well understood.  

Files in libmdb are licensed under LGPL and the utilities under the GPL, see 
COPYING.LIB and COPYING files respectively.
