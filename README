This is mdbtools version 0.3

This software is beta so don't expect too much unless you know C and 
probably a little something about databases and reverse engineering file 
formats, you're welcome to try it out but don't expect miracles.

For the rest of you, read the HACKING file for a description of where the code 
stands and what has been gleened of the file format.

The initial goal of these tools is to be able to extract data structures and 
data from mdb files.  This goal will of course expand over time as the file 
format becomes more well understood.  Also in the plans is a Gtk+ browser for 
MDB files and a ODBC/SQL frontend.

Files in libmdb are licensed under LGPL and the utilities under the GPL, see 
COPYING.LIB and COPYING files respectively.

To install see the INSTALL file
